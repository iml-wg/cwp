The contents of this community white paper (CWP) are a product of many community meetings and discussions that took place between December 2016 - January 2018 in the course of several workshops on machine learning and high-energy physics: S2I2, DS@HEP2017, IML2017 and ACAT2017.
 

The goals of the CWP are to define the physics drivers of the energy and intensity frontier during the next decade that can be addressed by an effective research and development program of machine learning applications in high-energy physics. In this context, the interaction of the high-energy physics and data science communities are discussed, prioritized areas of machine learning R\&D are proposed, machine learning software and hardware platforms and resources are analyzed and a roadmap of future sustainable development is presented.    

Machine learning in particle physics is a very fast-paced and growing field and therefore things evolve quickly. For this reason, the views in this document are provided as is with the knowledge that they have come from the specific time period when the relevant discussions took place.
