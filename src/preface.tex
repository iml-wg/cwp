The High-Energy Physics Machine Learning Community White Paper (CWP) is a product of many community meetings and discussions that took place in the course of several workshops on machine learning and high-energy physics in 2017.\\

The goals of the CWP are to define the physics drivers relevant to the energy and intensity frontier during the next decade that can be addressed by an effective research and development program of machine learning applications.
In the CWP the interaction of the high-energy physics and data science communities are discussed, prioritized areas of machine learning R\&D are proposed, machine learning software and hardware platforms and resources are analyzed and a roadmap of future sustainable development is presented.\\

Machine learning in particle physics is a very fast-paced field.
For this reason, the contents of this document reflect the state of the art at the time of the discussions and do not attempt to take later developments into account.
