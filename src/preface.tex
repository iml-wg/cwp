The contents of this community white paper (CWP) were mainly compiled during community meetings in spring 2017 that took place at several workshops on machine learning in high-energy physics: S2I2 and \cite{DSatHEP2017,IML2017,ACAT2017,HSF2017}.

The goals of the CWP are to define the physics drivers of the energy and intensity frontier during the next decade that can be addressed by an effective research and development program of machine learning applications. In this context, the interaction of the high-energy physics and data science communities is discussed, prioritized areas of machine learning R\&D are proposed, machine learning software and hardware platforms and resources are analyzed and a roadmap of future sustainable development is presented.

Machine learning in particle physics is a very fast-paced and growing field and therefore things evolve quickly. For this reason, the views in this document are provided as is with the knowledge that they have come from the specific time period when the relevant discussions took place.
