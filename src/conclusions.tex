% Conclusions
As particle physics moves into the post-Higgs boson discovery era, the physics drivers of the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider and future neutrino experiments will require increasingly more powerful identification and reconstruction algorithms to extract rare signals from copious and challenging backgrounds.\\

Machine learning algorithms are already state of the art in many areas of particle physics and will likely be called on to take on a greater role in solving upcoming data analysis and event reconstruction challenges.
In this document we have outlined the promising areas of research and development applications of machine learning in particle physics and focused on addressing the most important science drivers with these initiatives.
Additionally, we identified the need for greater collaboration with external communities in machine learning and a need to train the particle physics community in machine learning.
We also provided a roadmap for acceptance and implementation of described research and development initiatives into the workflows of particle physics experiments.
